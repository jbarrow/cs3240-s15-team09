THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD IN 18 MINUTES

9 aesthetics of game play
- fellowship
- challenge
- expression
- sensation
- narrative
- abnegation (surrender)
- fantasy
- competition
- discovery

okay on to the actual stuff

- law of entropy = the general tendency of the universe: to lack of order
and lack of structure
- but around us is staggering complexity
- linked by trade, travel, the internet
- HOW DOES THE UNIVERSE MAKE COMPLEXITY? IF THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS EXISTS
- lots of difficult = goldilocks conditions
- slightly more complexity = builds stage by stage
- new stage = utterly new
- threshold moments = going gets tougher, more fragile, goldilocks conditions more stringent as we get more complex
- why does complexity mean vulnerabililty and fragility

BIG HISTORY = the whole history of the universe
there is nothing, not even time or space
bam = a universe appears - very hot, contains everything and expanding
- distinct things come into being
- energy congeals to form matter = quarks, leptons, the forces
- simple atoms of hydrogen and helium
- huge clouds of H and He - no structure, cosmic mush?
- WMAP but there are differences = tiny temperature differentials
- gravity is more powerful with more stuff
- universe into clouds, compacting, temperature rises, temperature threshold = proton fusion and stars begin to appear
- stars die = high temp, protons fuse and form all of the elements = chemical complexity
- young stars = all of the elements combine and form particles, rocks, moons, planets, solar systems
- rocky planets are more complex than stars = different materials
- more vulnerable but creative = more complexity = living organisms = chemical packets
	- electromagnetic force
goldilocks cond for life
	- right amount of energy (enough combination energy)
	- diversity of chemical elements
	- liquids (atoms have mobility and link up)
early earth is almost perfect for goldilocks conditions
	- oceanic vents
	- warm
	- atoms combine
life > exotic chem
	- stabilizing?
		* stabilize the template and the template can copy itself
		* each rung has information
		* how to make
		* copies and scatter templates
		* DNA = information spreads
		* genetic diversity = learning how to make new ways of making living organisms
- single cells have great complexity
- multicell organisms
- asteroids like nuclear war conditions
- mammals flourished in niches left by dinosaurs
humans are a threshold in great story
-	DNA accumulates information through random errors
-	organisms with brain = learning in real time
-	die and the information dies with them
-	share what we learn, knowledge can outlast the individual
-	creative and powerful and we have a history
	* collective learning
	* migration into new lands, migration means new ways of exploiting environment
-	learn to farm
		* larger societies
		* linking globally - internet, trade, etc.
		* global brains learning at warp speed
-	energy bonanza - fossil fuels and collective learning

WARNINGS:
-	collective learnings: we may not be in charge of it
	* nuclear trap
	* burning fuels = undermine the goldilocks conditions for flourishing
WHY BIG HISTORY?
-	dangers of our fragility and our fragile circumstances
-	our power with collective learning
-	future generations to know big history and to know it well
	- the challenges and the opportunities
	- online big history syllabus
