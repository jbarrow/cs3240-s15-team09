OCCAM'S RAZOR
THE LAW OF PARSIMONY - if two theories have the same predictive
power, then choose the one that makes the fewest assumptions
- more complicated, may make better predictions, but fewer assumptions -- better

this applies to a particular context = the facets of simplicity may
work in different directions - simpler description, hypothesis, etc.
There may be tradeoffs

Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference = formalized razor
- shorter computable theories have more weight when calculating prob of
next observation

- guiding the dev. of theoretical models
- preference for simplicity 
- simplicity in scientific method = falsifiability criterion
- simpler theories are preferable to complex ones because they are
more easily tested

"entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity"

Aristotle = superior ceteris paribus [all things equal] of the demonstration
that derives from fewer postulates or hypotheses

"a plurality is not to be posited without necessity"
Numquam ponenda est pluralitas sine necessitate

- choose fewer because it produces knowleddge with fewer premises,
makes us know quickly

razor = shaving away unnecessary assumptions or cutting apart two similar conclusions

Russell modification = "Whenever possible, substitute constructions out 
of known entities for inferences to unknown entities"

Solomonoff = computable probability distribution

Layperson = simplest explanation is usually correct

* aesthetics = nature is simple and simpler hypotheses are more likely to be true
* empirical = excessively complex models are affected by statistical noise, simpler models may capture underlying structure better, better predictors

TESTING THE RAZOR
- all other things being equal, simpler explanations are generally better
than complex ones
- or simpler hypotheses are generally better than complex ones
- simpler hypotheses are generally mathematically rigourous and empirically verifiable
- only add complexity if it is necessary
- prevents the addition of ad hoc hypotheses where we just 
add justifications, making the hypothesis unfalsifiable
- each true explanation may have an infinite number of false and more complex
or false and simpler alternatives
- endless supply of elaborating explanations is possible - ruled out (not really)
	* but cut by Occam's Razor

- simpler theories are easier to understand
- heuristic maxim for choosing among models
- are we just forced to use Occam's Razor, just because it seems to be a
good candidate for a first principle?

MATH
- all assumptions introduce possibility for error, if assumption
does not improve the accuracy, then the only thing it does is to 
increase the probability that the theory is wrong
- quantify the degree that a proposition unnecessarily accommodates possible observable data
- hypothesis with fewer adjustable parameters will have enhanced posterior probability - predictions are sharp

- choose simpler for:
* aesthetics
* falsability criterion = simpler because better testable 
* more informative, less information required to answer a question
* but why should simplicity be considered when thinking about plausibility
	- simplicity considerations should not count unless they reflect something more fundamental
* if choice of theory cannot be determined by data, then we must have 
some criterion - the "principle of simplicity is a fundamental synthetic a priori truth"
* Occam's Razor = unnecessary elements in a symbolism mean nothing - signs with no purpose are logically meaningless

APPLICATIONS
- guide for development of models instead of arbiter 
- parsimony
- heuristic = not always right
= "everything should be kept as simple as possible but no simpler"
- parsimony is a epistemological, metaphysical, heuristic preference not a principle of logic
- accept the simplest possible theoretical exp. for existing data
- but simplest explanation can be ruled out as new data becomes available
- parsimony = in the context, cannot generalize parsimony
- there is little empirical evidence that the world is simple or that simple accounts are more likely to be true
- conservative tool = cut out crazy constructions

THREE AXIOMS, SCIENTIFIC METHOD
- realism (existence of an objective reality)
- existence of natural law
- constancy of natural law
- never been objectively falsified
- Occam's razor support axioms but don't prove

A single instance of Occam's Razor favoring a wrong theory falsifies the razor as a general principle
- hence it is a heuristic
- parsimonious approach does not guarantee a correct conclusion
- science does not demand arbitration or selection between models that make the same testable hypotheses

likelihood methods = parsimony - hypotheses requiring a few differing parameters as the null hypothesis
	- complex hypotheses must predict data much better before simple hypotheses are rejected
	- information theory is similar

"very rash to use simplicity and elegance as a guide in bio" <-- ongoing natural selection and random

Medicine = diagnostic parsimony = when diagnosing look for the fewest possible causes that will account for all
symptoms
- Hickam's dictum = "patients can have as many diseases as they damn well please"
- but can have multiple symptoms rather than a single rarer disease
	* because higher loss function - better to test and pursue all reasonable theories
- diagnostic parsimony and counterbalance Hickam's dicum = any set of symptoms could be indicative of a range of diseases
- testing and modification benefits from estimates
- never accept/reject based on one disease seeming more likely (purely on that, other factors, okay)

RELIGION
- explanation has no sufficient basis unless it is in harmony with religion, reason, experience <- Ockham
- Aquinas uses Occam's Razor to construct an objection to the existence of God
- most theologians base beliefs on grounds independent of reason, so Razor is irrelevant
- sometimes use God as a useful or neccessary assumption
- or that God would introduce unnecessary complexity
Berkeley = all of reality could be explained in terms of the mind alone
* Occam's Razor against materialism, matter is eliminable
- Occam's Razor is inconclusive regarding duality

PENAL ETHICS
- parsimony to avoid excessive punishment
* any punishment greater than is required to achieve its end is unjust
* true parsimony means that punishment should be individualized to account for sensitivity of the individual
	- but seems impractical

PROBABILITY AND STAT
- Razor from prob theory and apply it to stat inference
- only can apply to models with the same explanatory power
- Bayesian models
- AI using Occam learning
- change the form of the razor so that it can be used to compare models that don't fit data equally
- with math = becomes more rigourous 
- simplicity must be defined
- is Occam's razor subjective or objective?

OBJECTIVE?
- minimum universal Turing machine = same length description across different formulations
- natural Turing machine  of small size as bassis for excluding complex instruction set
- program for universal -- hypothesis
- representation of the evidence == program data
- sum of log universal prob of model + log prob of data should be minimized
- IDEAL DATA COMPRESSOR = scientific formulation generator
- math theory of razor is Solomonoff's theory of optimal inductive inference?

CONTROVERSY
- is not the recommendation for any simplest theory
- should be the last step to choose between theories that are already seen to be valid and equally supported by data
- prioritize empirical testing as well
- a theory can have more complex structure, but semantics can be simpler
	* lots of complex words to explain some simple concept
	* economy of grammar/vocab or practical expression

ANTI-RAZORS
- is it too extreme?
- Chatton - if 3 things are not enough to verify an affirmative proposition about things, a fourth must be added
- Leibniz - priniciple of plenitude = God created the most varied and populous of possible worlds
- Kant = the variety of beings should not be rashly diminished
- Menger = it is vain to do with fewer what requires more, not reduction to the point of inadequacy
