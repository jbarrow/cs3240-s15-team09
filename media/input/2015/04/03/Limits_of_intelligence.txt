THE LIMITS OF INTELLIGENCE - THE LAWS OF PHYSICS MAY PREVENT US FROM 
EVOLVING INTO SOMETHING MORE POWERFUL

Elephants = signals take more than 100 longer to travel between opposite
sides of its brain - need to think more about what it is to do because
reflexes are not a thing

the laws of physics place tough constraints on our mental faculties
- anatomic roadblocks to brain expansion? will we fit through the birth
canal?

- increase the number of neurons in the brain?
- boost rate at which neurons exchange information?
- but there are physical limits
	* neurons and statistically noisy chemical exchanges
	* information, noise, energy = thermodynamics
do the laws of thermodynamics impose a limit on neuron based intelligence?
but intelligence is really hard to define
is there a limit to the evolution of neuron-based intelligence for all life?

SUMMARY
- human intelligence is close to its limit?
- most of the tweaks that would make us smarter would hit the limits of the
laws of physics
- larger brains = energy hungry and slow
= better wiring = consume energy and space
- thinner wires = noisy communications
- collective knowledge and technology may allow us to expand our mind outside of our body

BRAIN SIZE VS. INTELLIGENCE
- mathematical laws related to body mass and brain mass
larger brain = more neurons, more complexity
but brains seem to expand with body size, so it is used for more trivialities
	* monitor more nerves, larger retinas, more muscles
Dubois = estimation of animal intelligencce based on the size of their skulls
	* relation between body size and brain size
	* mammalian brains expand more slowly than their bodies
	* ENCEPHALIZATION QUOTIENT = species' brain mass with what is predicted based on body mass
		- brain is about 3/4 power of body mass
		- what is the deviation from that estimate?
		- humans : 7.5 larger than prediction
		- dolphins: 5.3
 - intelligence may depend on amount of neural reserves that is left over after a brain's menial chores
- greater number of neural pathways that any one signal can travel means that the signal carries more information
- law of diminishing returns to increasing intelligence by adding brain cells
- size = energy consumption
- brain = 2% mass, expends 20% of calories

STAYING IN TOUCH
- communication networks
- cortex = communications take up 80% of consumption
- size increases, neuronal connectivity becomes more challenging - design principles of the brain and how the principles are maintained
across brains of different sizes
- axon bundles = nerves
- diameter of axons, size and density of nerve cells, number of synapses per cell
- as brains expand: 
	* average size of nerve cells increase	
		- allows neurons to connect to more as the number of neurons increase
		- but larger cells pack together less densely - distance increases and required axon length increases too
		- axons also need to be thicker to maintain speed
		- longer times to travel if all things were equal
	* divided into larger and larger number of distinct areas
		- specialized function
		- specialized function on either sides of the brain
		- specialization may compensate for the connectivity problem
			- impossible for neurons to be big enough to stay well connected
		- segregate like-functioned neurons into modules
		- fewer long distance connections between modules
		- reduce number of interhemispheric communication
	* basically tradeoffs = bigger brains need more changes to sustain the longer distances between cells
	* improve one, screw up another
		- expand the corpus callosum?
		- push the hemispheres apart so that the gains are neutralized
- neurons do get larger as brain size increases but not quite enough to stay well connected
- thicker axons not thick enough to make up for delays
- 2x axon width = 2x energy expenditure, increased velocity of only 40%
- axons (white) grow faster than gray matter (nucleus)
	* more volume is towards wiring instead of computational units

PRIMATES
- workarounds for the larger brain = not used for increased computational power issue
- primates = cortical neurons enlarge very little as the brain increases in size
- a few do, but the ones that do keep things well connected
- neurons still pack together as densely
- doubling in mass will mean that the number of neurons roughly double, whereas in other mammals, it would only be 60%
- huge differences - if we used the same scaling laws, then would have 45 kg brain to deal with
* smaller densely packed neurons *
	- predicting intelligence by behavioral complexity
	- only tight correlation with intelligence is the # of neurons in the cortex + speed of neuronal activity
		- speed decreases with distance between neurons
		- increases with myelination
	- faster communications as the cells are packed more tightly
- larger neurons and brains can be inefficient - larger distance, slower nerve velocity

people with the quickest lines of communication between their neurons = brightest, most intelligent
- shorter paths between brain areas is correlated with higher IQ
- compare working memory to estimate how fast communication flows between brain areas
- most direct communication and fastest "neural chatter" = best working memory
- brains are larger = savev space and energy by limiting the number of direct connections
- rare, nonstop connections are what makes us smarter

INTELLIGENCE DESIGN
- communication between neurons, between brain areas is a bottleneck?
- smaller neurons, closer together 
- axons that carry signals faster over longer distances without getting thicker?
- THE MOTHER OF ALL LIMITATIONS = proteins than are used to generate electrical pulses are unreliable
- ion channels can be flipped open or closed, so the signals are not always reliable
- ion channel flutters on and off randomly- by changing the voltage, you just change the likelihood that it opens

TRADEOFFS
- spring on the channel loose, then noise switches it
- spring is stronger, then you need to input more work
- neurons save energy by using hair-trigger ion channels
- reliable only if you use a large number of channels to vote if the impulse came through
- reduce the size of the neurons, reduce the number of channels that are available - increase noise

axons to 150 - 200 nm = impossibly noisy
- so few ion channels that accidentally opening one channel can cause axon to deliver the signal mistakenly
- cortical gray matter neurons are working with axons that are close to the physical limit

information, energy, noise
transistors at 22 nm <-- hard to dope silicon uniformly
at 10 nm <--- single random absence/presence of boron atom can cause unpredictable behavior

engineers can scrap the current design, but evolution cannot 
circuits that underlie vision, smell, navigation, etc. have the same basic arrangement
- some physiological solution has reached maturity
- optimal neural blueprint?

BEES
- have humans reached the physical limits of brain complexity?
- more like a law of diminishing returns...
-- only so many neurons, only so many neuronal connections, only so many electrical impulses per second
- energy consumption, dissipation of heat, time

SO HOW DO WE GET SMARTER?
- collective intelligence, like honeybees and hive sisters
- social interaction = pool our intelligence with others
- Internet as the expansion of intelligence outside of our bodies
- maybe the Internet makes you stupid, because we have reduced the need for evolving individual smarts

physics of thought
- smaller components, more power and become faster
- axons allow neurons to form networks
- signals and action potentials = open ion channels that let the ions through
- enough ions cross a channel, change the voltage, causing other channels to open
- thinner axons, consume less energy
