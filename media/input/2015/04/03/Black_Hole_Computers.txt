BLACK HOLE COMPUTERS - the laws of physics as computer programs. 
The universe as a computer.

- all physical systems are computers because they register and process information
- every electron, elementary particle stores information (data bits)
- transformation of data = bits are transformed
- getting data to a black hole is not a problem, getting information out
is impossible
- Hawking: black holes do have an output - hawking radiation, but the
energy released does not carry useful information that can reconstruct
what entered the black hole

apparent loss of information? Law of quantum say that the amount of 
info is conserved. What if the output radiation is not random --> processed
matter of what falls in? Probably.

The universe also registers and computes information
information theory to explain laws of thermodynamics
entropy = proportional to the number of bits registered by positions and
velocities of molecules in a substance
qubits = bits that make up the universe with more information than regular bits

THE UNIVERSE IS A GIANT QUANTUM COMPUTER

*When Gigahertz is too slow*
maxim of quantum mechanics = nature is discrete
each particle has a spin = one of two directions, therefore a bit
flipping the spin is a simple computation
discrete time = minimum amount of time to flip a bit
Heisenburg uncertainty = trade offs in measuring physical quantities
the amount of time to flip a bit depends on the amount of energy that we put in
amount of energy is inversely proportional to time required
- allows us to think about the computational limits of the universe
- matter = its battery is itself - matter converted to energy
- all of the energy is used for computation, slowing down as energy degrades

existence = storing information
if information escapes from a black hole, it can compute
size(memory space) proportional to (computation rate)^2
discrete atoms of space/time may be larger than expected - laws of physics
limit the power of computers and precision of measurement

WHAT'S A COMPUTER?
- physical objects can solve a broad class of math/logic though I/O may not 
be present
- natural computers - depends on particle spin
ULTIMATE LAPTOP
- data in: particle positions, spin, velocity
- computation: particle interaction, collision
- out: particles leaving - measure their properties
BLACK HOLE
- in: data and instructions are encoded in matter and pulled in
- compute: descent, particles interact
- out: black hole radiation, carries computation output

entropy proportional, energy/temperature
ultimate = all of the particles encode info
- information in the microscopic motions and positions

particles = variables
interactions = ops
asynchronous - bit can flip super fast, system too fast to have a central clock
work in parallel - all independent threads, communication between threads is slower
matter converted completely to energy

NANOTECH TO XENNOTECH
-black hole = computer compressed to smallest possible size
size(black hole) = Schwartzchild radius
- shrinking a computer does not change its energy content
- speed of computation is proportional to the matter it contains
- memory = number of particles and the volume
- gravity dominates = interconnection of particles - capable of storing less information
- much less memory than uncompressed
- black hole is faster
- time to flip a bit = time to move from one side of hole to other
- very serial
- prepare the input data = black hole can execute any program
- except that once the data enters it is gone
- particles fall - perform computation for finite time before reaching center
- output: Hawking radiation - peak wavelength of radiation equals hole radius
- capture the radiation and convert to HR
- rate at which black holes radiate is inversely proportional to size
- BLACK HOLES - TRANSIENT CONGREGATION OF MATTER - PERFORMS COMPUTATION
AT MAXIMUM RATE

ultimate laptop = parallel
	* communication slower than computation
black hole - serial (single processor)
	* commuication as fast as computation

ESCAPE PLAN
- does hawking radiation really encode meaningful information?
- matter cannot leave, but information can
- escape hatch is entanglement? - properties of systems are correlated across space-time
	* teleportation
ENTANGLEMENT
- entangle particles
- measurement on one of the particles jointly with matter with information
- measurement erases some of the info on original particle
- information is teleported to other entangled particle
- information decoded using measuremente results as a key

BLACK HOLE
- entangled photons at the event horizon
- one particle falls into singularity, other emitted
- annihilation of one = measurement
- information is transferred to the second one as output Hawking radiation
- don't need the result of measurement to decode information
- annihilation has only one outcome - calculation outcome and decode
- final singularity has a unique state

ESCAPE VIA WEIRD QUANTUM PHENOMENA
- black holes are composite bodies make up of branes (string theory)
- info in: waves in the branes, which can leak out
- black hole = fuzzy ball of strings
	* radiation = information carried

Hawking model:
- pairs of particles materialize at event horizon
- one annihilated, other flies out
- spins are random

HOROWITZ-MALDACENA
- outgoing particle = raw mass and information
- mechanical entanglement

CYBERSPACETIME
- small scales = spacetime is bubbly and foamy
- max amount of information that can be input depends on smallness of the bits
- are these foamy cells larger? No fixed size?
- how to map the geometry of spacetime?
- like satellites = satellite sends a signal and see how long it takes to arrive
- precision depends on how fast the clocks tick
- energy increases more slowly than the volume does
- measurements are useful when measuring apparatus is on the verge of becoming a black hole

number of bits in a memory is proportional to square of computational rate
- link between information and special relativity

HOLOGRAPHICAL PRINCIPLE
- our three-D universe is actually 2-D?
- maximum amount of information a space can store is governed by surface area, not volume
- holographic principle seems to follow from fundamental quantum limits to measurement precision

42
- computation: black holes, spacetime foam, universe and infinity
- how many operations occurred since the creation of our universe?
- the universe must have performed the maximum  number of computations allowed by laws of physics
matter can embody teh most information when it is energy, massless particles
( like phones, neutrinos )
universe computation is more like an ultimate laptop because it would be paralle

DARK ENERGY
- the number of bits that the universe can store approx equal to # computations/operations
- universe is close to the critical density
- if more dense, collapse into a black hole
- universe nearly meets criteria for maxing out the number of computations that it can perform
- the maximum number of computations at the universe can perform ~the number of operations that could
be performed up to that moment

REGULAR MATTER VS. DARK ENERGY
- ordinary : huge number of operations
- dark: overwhelming majority have had only time to flip once over the
course of cosmic history
- dark matter has not done a lot of computation
- supplying missing mass and accelerating its expansion = simple tasks

WHAT IS THE UNIVERSE COMPUTING?
- THE UNIVERSE IS COMPUTING ITSELF
- computing quantum fields, chemicals, bacteria, humans, stars
- computing its own spacetime geometry
- COMPUTATION IS EXISTENCE
- universal computation = conceptual interconnections of fundamental physics
	* quantum information

dark energy = slower, more memory than normal matter

measurement uncertainty = varies with the size of the object being measured, larger an object is, the 
fuzzier its structure - measurement imprecision is independent of the objecct
your choice of what to measure = affects fine-scale structure of spacetime
